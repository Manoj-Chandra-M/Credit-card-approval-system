# Data Engineering Project: Modern ETL Pipeline Implementation for Credit Card Fraud Detection
## Project Overview:
Implemented an end-to-end data engineering solution using the Mage ETL pipeline tool to enhance credit card fraud detection processes.

## Technical Skills:

### ETL Processing:

Extracted and stored customer transaction data into GCP bucket for analysis, leveraging Mage as the primary ETL tool.
Developed transformation logic in Python for efficient data processing and cleaning.

### Machine Learning Integration:

Applied advanced ML models, including Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Classifier, to predict credit card application outcomes.
Automated the credit approval process using Azure Automated ML, resulting in a remarkable model accuracy improvement to 88.4%.

### Data Warehousing:

Utilized Lucidchart for dimensional modeling, implementing a Star Schema for enhanced readability and visualization.
Converted analysis results into fact and dimension tables, optimizing data storage and retrieval efficiency.

### Cloud Platform Utilization:

Deployed the Mage instance on GCP Compute Engine, ensuring scalable and reliable ETL processing.
Loaded the final results into BigQuery, a powerful data warehouse on GCP, enabling seamless analytical queries.

## Achievements:

### Enhanced Model Accuracy:

Automated credit approval using Azure Automated ML, leading to a significant improvement in model accuracy to 88.4%.

### Optimized Data Retrieval:

Implemented dimensional modeling, following the Star Schema, resulting in improved data retrieval efficiency.

### Visual Analytics:

Derived meaningful insights from credit data through exploratory data analysis using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Prepared a comprehensive database for analysis in Looker Studio, facilitating the creation of insightful dashboards.

### Impact:

Transformed raw transaction data into a refined dataset, enabling robust credit card fraud detection. The integration of advanced ML models and optimization of data storage and retrieval processes contributed to a more accurate and efficient credit approval system.
