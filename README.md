# Credit-card-approval-system

You have been hired as a Machine Learning analyst for a reputed bank in Canada. You are incharge of approving or rejecting credit card applications by analyzing the customer data provided to you. Since the number of applications submitted to the bank increases day by day, the Senior Manager of the bank decides to automate the process and suggests to build a Machine Learning algorithm to analyze and predict an outcome for every credit card application submitted. You are asked to carry out the same and required to provide the best model to the Manager so that the model can be used for production environment immediately.

. Built a Decision Tree Classifier with F1 score of 0.85 to predict an outcome for credit card applications submitted to a bank.
. Analyzed, cleaned and implemented one-hot-encoding on the data to handle categorical variables.
. Performed pre-processing, exploratory data analysis and feature importance to derive meaningful insights from data.
. Automated the credit approval process using Azure Automated ML and VotingEnsemble algorithm was chosen as best model with accuracy of 88.4% out of 60 classification algorithms.
